<p class="fixed">The sun was setting over the horizon, painting the sky in vibrant shades of orange and pink.
     A gentle breeze rustled the leaves, carrying the faint scent of blooming flowers. 
     As the day came to a close, the world seemed to slow down, offering a moment of peace and reflection. 
     It was in these quiet instants that life felt most beautiful, a reminder to appreciate the simple joys 
     around us.

    <p class="sticky">Meanwhile, the city buzzed with energy, its streets alive with the sounds of laughter and conversation.
        Neon signs flickered to life, casting colorful reflections on the wet pavement after a brief rain. 
        People hurried past, each lost in their own thoughts and destinations, yet connected by the 
        shared rhythm of urban life. Despite the chaos, there was a sense of unityâ€”a collective 
        heartbeat driving the night forward.
